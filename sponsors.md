# DevOps DC Meetup Sponsorship Opportunities

DevOps DC is a meetup group that includes more than 1,000 local technologists and meets on a monthly basis.  Our meetings typically draw 45-70 people who are interested in sharing and learning about the people, processes, and tools required to build and operate high velocity organizations.
