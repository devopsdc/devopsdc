# DevOps DC Meetup Sponsorship Opportunities

DevOps DC is a meetup group that includes more than 1,000 local technologists and meets on a monthly basis.  Our meetings typically draw 45-70 people who are interested in sharing and learning about the people, processes, and tools required to build and operate high velocity organizations.

Sponsoring our meetings is a great way to get involved with the local technology community.

We have a number of different sponsorship levels and unique sponsorship opportunities available.

Which of these sponsorship options best suits your needs? Please let us know so that we can make arrangements for you to sponsor some of our upcoming events!

## Food Sponsor
Sponsor food for our monthly meetup!  Food sponsorship is *$300 for each event*.  The food sponsorship money will be used towards pizza (or other similar food) and paper goods.  Food sponsorship money may also be used to supplement beverage costs for the event.  The food sponsor will be thanked by the MC and have 5 minutes to address the meeting attendees.

## Beverage Sponsor
Sponsor beverages for our monthly meetup!  Beverage sponsorship is *$200 for each event* and will cover beer for the event.  Beverage sponsorship money may also be used to cover wine, soft drinks, and to supplement food costs for the event.  The beverage sponsor will be thanked by the MC and have 3 minutes to address the meeting attendees.

## Logistics

One food and one beverage sponsorship is available each meeting.

DevOps DC does not share contact information of our attendees with our sponsors.  However, sponsors are more than welcome to ask meeting attendees to share their information.
