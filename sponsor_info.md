# DevOps DC Meetup Sponsorship Opportunities

DevOps DC is a meetup group that includes more than 2,000 local technologists and meets on a monthly basis.  Our meetings typically draw 45-70 people who are interested in sharing and learning about the people, processes, and tools required to build and operate high velocity organizations.

Sponsoring our meetings is a great way to get involved with the local technology community.

We have a number of different sponsorship levels and unique sponsorship opportunities available.

Which of these sponsorship options best suits your needs? Please let us know so that we can make arrangements for you to sponsor some of our upcoming events!

## Food Sponsor

Sponsor food for our monthly meetup!  Food sponsorship is roughly *$300 for each event*.  We ask that the food sponsor provide pizza, or other food of their choice, and paper goods sufficient to feed the meeting attendees.  As a general rule, this usually means 12-15 pizzas though it may require more depending on the number of attendees.  The sponsor should take on all arrangements for ordering and delivery of the food.  The food sponsor will:
  * be thanked by the MC
  * have 4 minutes to address the meeting attendees, along with one slide
  * be thanked on the MeetUp event page
  * be listed on the [Meetup Sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/DevOpsDC/sponsors/) page

## Beverage Sponsor

Sponsor beverages for our monthly meetup!  Beverage sponsorship is roughly *$200 for each event*.  We ask the beverage sponsor to provide beer and soft drinks in sufficient quantities for the meeting attendees.  As a general rule, one-and-a-half or two cases of beer and 6-8 2 liter bottles of soda is enough.  The group tends to prefer craft beer and local over mass produced beers.  The beverage sponsorwill:
  * be thanked by the MC
  * have 4 minutes to address the meeting attendees, along with one slide
  * be thanked on the MeetUp event page
  * be listed on the [Meetup Sponsors](https://www.meetup.com/DevOpsDC/sponsors/) page
  
## Logistics

One food and one beverage sponsorship is available each meeting.
